# Python Calculator
This is a simple calculator that I am making as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge specifically with Python. I since I am still getting familiar with Python, I wanted to do a project that was relatively simple, and one that I didn't have to watch a tutorial for.

You can find what I am working on in my #100DaysOfPython over at my Twitter, [found here](https://twitter.com/russintech/status/1687943560409038848?s=20).

## To-do List
- Make the input section it's own function.
- Add ability to use floats.
- Let the user do 3 numbers.
- Add exponents

## Implemented Features
### Phase 1
- The program takes an input in a simple format (XX + YY), and can spit out the answer.
- Currently accepts +, -, *, and / as operators.
- Currently only works with integers, but will spit out decimals for unequal division.
